House Price Prediction using Linear Regression:
This project aims to implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Overview:
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable(in this case,house prices) and one or more independent variables(square footage,number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms).By training a linear regression model on historical housing data, we can make the predictions about the prices of new houses.
Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains information about houses including their square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and corresponding prices.
Implementation:
The Implementation of the Linear Regression model is done using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy,pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn.The steps involved include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions.
